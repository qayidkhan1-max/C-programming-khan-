Got it. I’ll rewrite everything fully in English and keep it clear, neat, and ready to write in your notebook.
(Explanations will be simple and correct.)

1. What do you mean by arrays? Give one example of an array and how to declare an array.

Answer:
An array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in continuous memory locations.
It allows us to store multiple values using a single variable name.

Declaration:

data_type array_name[size];

Example:

int marks[5];        // This array stores 5 integer values

Initialization Example:

int marks[5] = {85, 90, 75, 80, 95};

2. What do you mean by functions? Write types of functions and give one example of each.

Answer:
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.
Functions help to reuse code and make programs modular and organized.

Types of Functions:

1. Function with no arguments and no return value


2. Function with arguments but no return value


3. Function with arguments and return value



Example 1: No arguments, no return value

#include<stdio.h>
void hello() {
    printf("Hello World");
}
int main() {
    hello();
    return 0;
}

Example 2: With arguments, no return value

#include<stdio.h>
void sum(int a, int b) {
    printf("Sum = %d", a + b);
}
int main() {
    sum(10, 5);
    return 0;
}

Example 3: With arguments and return value

#include<stdio.h>
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
int main() {
    int result = add(7, 3);
    printf("Result = %d", result);
    return 0;
}

3. What do you mean by pointers? Write a code to initialize a pointer.

Answer:
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

Declaration:

data_type *pointer_name;

Example Code:

#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int *p;       // pointer declaration
    p = &x;       // pointer initialization

    printf("Value of x = %d\n", x);
    printf("Address of x = %p\n", p);
    printf("Value using pointer = %d", *p);
    return 0;
}

4. What are the types of array? Write code including 1D and 2D arrays.

Types of Arrays:

1. One Dimensional Array (1D)


2. Two Dimensional Array (2D)



1D Array Example:

int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

2D Array Example:

int matrix[2][3] = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6}
};

5. Explain the types of operators in C with code.

Types of Operators:

1. Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %


2. Relational Operators: >, <, ==, !=


3. Logical Operators: &&, ||, !


4. Assignment Operator: =



Example Code:

#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 3;

    printf("Addition = %d\n", a + b);
    printf("Is a greater than b? %d\n", a > b);
    printf("Logical AND: %d\n", (a > 5 && b < 5));

    return 0;
}
